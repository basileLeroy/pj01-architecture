        Everything in this site insists on the notion ‘to architect’.
        <br/><br/>
        The name of this site <span style='font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;'>‘architecturer.net’</span> is there to honour this word on the first page of ‘Vers 
        une architecture’ of Le Corbusier. “<span style='font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;'>….Architecturer! ce n’est pas là que travail technique de professionnel. 
        C’est aux tournants caractéristiques, un mouvement impulsif de l’idée commune, 
        qui manifeste en quel mode elle entend ordonner ses actes…..</span>”
        <br/><br/>
        This site is also a ‘net’ in the intention of a ‘network’<br/>
        It opens itself on same level to<br/>
        the ones who want to realise a project with marc Belderbos or the ones who would like to work<br/> 
        with him together on a project, on a theory, written or drawn.<br/>
        it opens itself<br/>
        to the ones who just want to share some ideas, or want to bring on the site an intervention over the theme: ‘architecturer –to architect’.
        <br/><br/>
        The name of this site network of ideas is so ‘architecturer.net’
        It indicates a precise mind inclination towards architecture
        not as a ’product’ or an ‘object’ of a ‘designer’
        but as an ethical operation in the real.
        <br/><br/>
        It is to this desire<br/>
        to live with and to work at<br/>
        this notion and this practice: to architect<br/>
        that all are invited.<br/>
        Clients, critics, architecture lovers, and all the ones who think.
        <br/><br/>
        To architect is a pro-position<br/>
        which precedes the subject and the object.
        <br/><br/>
        To architect is a verb.
        <br/><br/>
        To architect let us live in the connotation of this:<br/>
        Be a subject and have a holding!</p>",
