        "<p><span style='font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;'>‘To architect’</span> is to establish an order<br/>
        whereas there is none.
        <br/><br/>
        The orders of architecture are<br/>
        structural primitive intentions<br/>
        which hold the matter<br/>
        at the commencement.
        <br/><br/>
        They are not images<br/>
        or figures of an order which would be elsewhere<br/>
        nor of styles, idealistic figures of remand to the past.
        <br/><br/>
        The orders don’t show anything<br/>
        they are inaugurating the notion of holding<br/>
        at dis-stance of the real<br/>
        for the subject who is living there.
        <br/><br/>
        There is a relation of ‘side to side’,<br/>
        if not a relation of ‘crossing’<br/>
        between the holding of the matter<br/>
        and the holding of the subject<br/>
        who is there and becomes ‘the there’,<br/>
        the subject of architecture.
        <br/><br/>
        All this is necessary from this that<br/>
        the holding of what distinguishes itself primitively,<br/>
        barely as a ‘thing’ in the real,<br/>
        is the constant primary interrogation<br/>
        of the un-animal anthrop.<br/>
        The un-animal anthrop is ‘question’.<br/>
        And this interrogation is endless.<br/>
        Never it has an adequate final answer.<br/>
        It lasts.
        <br/><br/>
        ‘To architect’ sustain this interrogation.<br/>
        Architecture sustain the ‘question’<br/>
        Architecture sustain the un-animal anthrop<br/>
        Architecture affirms eventually the question<br/>
        without ever tell an answer.<br/>
        This, like in poetry,<br/>
        before all signification<br/>
        by inaugural events<br/>
        by stances at dis-stances.
        <br/><br/>
        Architecture is dis-stance.<br/>
        Dis-stance of the question to the real,<br/>
        Dis-stance on the real for the question.
        <br/><br/>
        Dis-stance, is to establish a holding.<br/>
        Without more. Without any deposit in signification.<br/>
        It is a sense without signification.<br/>
        A passage from stance to stance or stances<br/>
        by dis-stance or at dis-stances.
        <br/><br/>
        Architecture establish itself in the dis-stance.<br/>
        And this is an introduction to the holding.
        <br/><br/>
        Architecture establish a holding<br/>
        whereas there isn’t.
        <br/><br/>
        Architecture is an operation.<br/>
        So it is nor a notion, nor a concept.
        <br/><br/>
        Architecture permits us to hold us on the real.<br/>
        Or to hold us at dis-stance of the real.
        <br/><br/>
        The order, -principle of the architecture-,<br/>
        is there therefore.<br/>
        It commences to weave.<br/>
        It doesn’t weave. It commences to weave.
        <br/><br/>
        There is more holding<br/>
        in commencing to weave<br/>
        than in weaving.
        <br/><br/>
        Before order, there is no holding.<br/>
        Before order, there is no reality.<br/>
        Before order, there is only the real.<br/>
        With order, which permits holding<br/>
        the life of the question or the anthropic life is permitted,<br/>
        because on the order it is deposed<br/>
        et by order it is proposed.
        <br/>
        Order or ‘to commence to weave’<br/>
        is to establish at distance from the real<br/>
        a holding from where<br/>
        the life of the question, or the anthropic life,<br/>
        can hold itself and welcome the events.<br/>
        Order is the welcome and the inauguration<br/>
        of the anthropic life.
        <br/><br/>
        Order is so a commencement and not an origin.<br/>
        Order is not an accomplishment.<br/>
        Order permits but doesn’t make anything.<br/>
        Order is a restricted action.<br/>
        There is a ethical restraint of order.<br/>
        It commences to weave. It doesn’t weave.
        <br/><br/>
        The principle of order is the principle of architecture.<br/>
        They are commencements.
        <br/><br/>
        The ‘doric’ order indicates the holding of the point,<br/>
        crossing, concentration and irradiation of the point which becomes line.
        <br/><br/>
        The ‘ionic’ order indicates the holding of the line which curves itself and establish the surface.
        <br/><br/>
        The ‘corinthian’ order indicates the curvature of the surface to a volume.<br/>
        The ‘composite’ order indicates how side by side,<br/>
        the holdings of the point, the line, and the volume<br/>
        wears the holding of the anthrop in a body brought to the world in his ‘real’ nudity at the very<br/> 
        moment where he becomes reality in all his question.<br/>
        Just look at it.
        <br/><br/>
        Architecture maintains itself there.<br/>
        It permits to the one who is there<br/>
        –the subject of architecture-<br/>
        to be close to a primitive notion of holding<br/>
        at dis-stance of the real<br/>
        scripture by the matter in order<br/>
        of the augur of the anthropic life<br/>
        be founded in holding<br/>
        or in dignity.</p>",
