        This with the foundation thoughts which leads to this work.There are drawings and projects.

        Everything in this site insists on the notion ‘to architect’.
        <br/><br/>
        The name of this site <span style='font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;'>‘architecturer.net’</span> is there to honour this word on the first page of ‘Vers 
        une architecture’ of Le Corbusier. “<span style='font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;'>….Architecturer! ce n’est pas là que travail technique de professionnel. 
        C’est aux tournants caractéristiques, un mouvement impulsif de l’idée commune, 
        qui manifeste en quel mode elle entend ordonner ses actes…..</span>”
        <br/><br/>
        This site is also a ‘net’ in the intention of a ‘network’<br/>
        It opens itself on same level to<br/>
        the ones who want to realise a project with marc Belderbos or the ones who would like to work<br/> 
        with him together on a project, on a theory, written or drawn.<br/>
        it opens itself<br/>
        to the ones who just want to share some ideas, or want to bring on the site an intervention over the theme: ‘architecturer –to architect’.
        <br/><br/>
        The name of this site network of ideas is so ‘architecturer.net’
        It indicates a precise mind inclination towards architecture
        not as a ’product’ or an ‘object’ of a ‘designer’
        but as an ethical operation in the real.
        <br/><br/>
        It is to this desire<br/>
        to live with and to work at<br/>
        this notion and this practice: to architect<br/>
        that all are invited.<br/>
        Clients, critics, architecture lovers, and all the ones who think.
        <br/><br/>
        To architect is a pro-position<br/>
        which precedes the subject and the object.
        <br/><br/>
        To architect is a verb.
        <br/><br/>
        To architect let us live in the connotation of this:<br/>
        Be a subject and have a holding!</p>",
    
    'articleProjects' => 
        "<p>The intentions where we are holding us<br/>
        all along our projects<br/>
        are tended to the ‘well being” of the ones who will live<br/>
        with our architecture.
        <br/><br/>
        This “well being” is a <span style='font-weight: bold;'>dignity</span> or a <span style='font-weight: bold;'>holding</span><br/>
        and not the fruition of a lust<br/>
        Well being is to live by ethics.
        <br/><br/>
        Architecture let people live with a structure<br/>
        and in the connotation of a holding.<br/>
        <br/><br/>
        The task of the architect<br/>
        is to build the space of life of people<br/>
        and then to let them live there.<br/>
        The space of life will then be connoted<br/>
        by this structure called architecture.
        <br/><br/>
        Therefor, the beauty of architecture<br/>
        will consist in a high level of logic<br/>
        more then in an esthetical sentiment.
        <br/><br/>
        Architecture will also bring at stake an idea<br/>
        of the holding or of the dignity in the society<br/>
        of the ones who will live there<br/>
        more then a particular fruition.<br/>
        The ones who build with us<br/>
        are subjects and not ‘particulars’<br/>
        and will be able to live with<br/>
        this primitive (arke) invisible and mute structure (tekton).
        <br/><br/>
        In the professional field<br/>
        our position is therefore<br/>
        that design (drawing and project)<br/>
        has an influence on people’s life<br/>
        We attempt permanently<br/>
        to reach a design of high quality<br/>
        to obtain a significant experience<br/>
        in all the spectrum of our build environment.
        <br/><br/>
        Excellence in design,<br/>
        continuous multidisciplinary interests<br/>
        fine precision of the control<br/>
        of the programme and the budget<br/>
        during all the phases of the construction<br/>
        are the bases of our work<br/>
        for an architecture of the highest quality.
        <br/><br/>
        Our work is animated<br/>
        by a constant ‘philosophical’ approach<br/>
        more than a proposition of ‘style’.<br/>
        And we aim to design detailed buildings<br/>
        which are intimately in relation with the environment<br/>
        and with the wished life experience and functions.
        <br/><br/>
        Intense discussions between all parties<br/>
        are at the base of a high quality of project<br/>
        which brings always in the light a synthesis in a simple concept<br/>
        of beauty, experience of well being and functionality.</p>",
